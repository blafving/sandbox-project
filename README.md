# sandbox-project
Catchall folder for my unwholesome experiments with django. 

Currently working on a fitness app that will store and analyze Fitness data. Way before V1.

Currently building import form so you can import blocks of data easily... 

Miscellaneous features
    1. Statistics built on cal balance (weekly, monthly, etc.)
    2. Compare these estimates with monthly weight readings
    3. (Far future - suggest changes to Base Metabolic Rate)

Will add exercises
    1. Manually input calories (admin) to calculate in daily calorie balance (Models)
    2. User side form input
    3. Integrate with phone app api (ideally google fit but could be other)

Will add analytics/graphing functionality

BIG Feature! .FIT file upload and analysis coming in summer
